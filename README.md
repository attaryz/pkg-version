A VS Code extension that helps you keep track of package dependencies across multiple package managers. It automatically scans your workspace for package files and shows you which dependencies are outdated.

## Features

- **Multi-Package Manager Support**: Works with npm (package.json), Composer (composer.json), Python (requirements.txt), and Dart/Flutter (pubspec.yaml)
- **Update Status Indicators**: Visual indicators show the type of update available (major, minor, patch)
- **Tree View**: Organized view of all package files and their dependencies
- **Exclusion System**: Ability to exclude folders from scanning to improve performance

## Usage

### Viewing Dependencies

1. Open the Explorer view in VS Code
2. Look for the "PACKAGE DEPENDENCIES" section in the sidebar
3. Click on a package file to expand and see its dependencies
4. Dependencies with available updates will show the current and latest version with color-coded indicators:
   - ðŸ”´ Major updates (potentially breaking changes)
   - ðŸŸ  Minor updates (new features, non-breaking)
   - ðŸŸ¡ Patch updates (bug fixes)
   - ðŸ”µ Prerelease versions

### Commands

The extension provides several commands that can be accessed via the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`):

- **Check Package Updates**: Manually trigger a check for outdated dependencies
- **Refresh Dependencies**: Refresh the dependencies tree view
- **Exclude Folder**: Exclude a folder from dependency scanning
- **Manage Exclusions**: View and remove folder exclusions

### Excluding Folders

To exclude folders from scanning (useful for large monorepos or test directories):

1. Right-click on a folder in the Explorer view
2. Select "Exclude Folder from Package Checks"
3. The folder will be excluded from future scans

To manage exclusions:
1. Open the Command Palette
2. Search for "Package Version: Manage Exclusions"
3. Select the exclusions you want to remove

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:
