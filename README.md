- **Update Status Indicators**: Visual indicators show the type of update available (major, minor, patch)
- **One-Click Updates**: Update packages directly from the dependencies view
- **Bulk Update**: Update all outdated packages with a single click
- **Tree View**: Organized view of all package files and their dependencies
- **Exclusion System**: Ability to exclude folders from scanning to improve performance

## Usage

### Viewing Dependencies

1. Open the Explorer view in VS Code
2. Look for the "PACKAGE DEPENDENCIES" section in the sidebar
3. Click on a package file to expand and see its dependencies
4. Dependencies with available updates will show the current and latest version with color-coded indicators:
   - ðŸ”´ Major updates (potentially breaking changes)
   - ðŸŸ  Minor updates (new features, non-breaking)
   - ðŸŸ¡ Patch updates (bug fixes)
   - ðŸ”µ Prerelease versions

### Updating Packages

The extension provides several ways to update packages:

1. **Update a Single Package**:
   - Hover over a dependency with an available update
   - Click the "Update Package" button that appears
   - The package will be updated to the latest version while preserving version constraints (^, ~, etc.)

2. **Update All Packages**:
   - Click the update all icon in the Package Dependencies view header
   - Confirm that you want to update all outdated packages
   - The extension will update all outdated packages and show a progress notification

### Commands

The extension provides several commands that can be accessed via the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`):

- **Check Package Updates**: Manually trigger a check for outdated dependencies
- **Refresh Dependencies**: Refresh the dependencies tree view
- **Update Package**: Update a selected package to the latest version
- **Update All Packages**: Update all outdated packages at once
- **Exclude Folder**: Exclude a folder from dependency scanning
- **Manage Exclusions**: View and remove folder exclusions

### Excluding Folders

To exclude folders from scanning (useful for large monorepos or test directories):

1. Right-click on a folder in the Explorer view
2. Select "Exclude Folder from Package Checks"
3. The folder will be excluded from future scans

To manage exclusions:
1. Open the Command Palette
2. Search for "Package Version: Manage Exclusions"
3. Select the exclusions you want to remove

## Extension Settings

## Supported Package Managers

| Package Manager | File | Registry |

## Features in Detail

### Version Preservation

When updating packages, the extension preserves the original version constraints:
- `^1.0.0` â†’ `^2.0.0` (preserves caret)
- `~1.0.0` â†’ `~1.2.0` (preserves tilde)
- `>=1.0.0` â†’ `>=1.2.0` (preserves greater than or equal)

### Multi-File Support

If your workspace contains multiple package files of the same type, the extension will ask you which file to update when using the update functionality.

## Planned Features

- Support for additional package managers (Cargo, Go modules, etc.)
- Improved handling of complex version constraints
- Caching to reduce API calls
- Offline mode
