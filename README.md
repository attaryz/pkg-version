A VS Code extension for checking and updating package dependencies across multiple package managers.

## Features

* Support for multiple package managers:
  * npm (Node.js)
  * Composer (PHP)
  * PyPI (Python)
  * Pub.dev (Dart/Flutter)
* Visual indicators showing update status (major, minor, patch)
* One-click dependency updates
* Bulk update capabilities
* Status bar notification of available updates
* Flexible exclusion options:
  * Folder exclusion for large projects
  * Custom pattern exclusion for granular control
  * Automatic exclusion of lock files (package-lock.json, composer.lock, etc.)
* Improved user interface:
  * Enhanced options menu with intuitive icons
  * Organized command grouping for better usability
  * Consistent visual styling throughout the extension

## Code Structure

The codebase has been modularized for better maintainability and future extensibility:

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ models/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ dependency.ts            # Dependency TreeItem model
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ fileUtils.ts             # File system utilities 
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ registryFetchers.ts      # Registry API interaction
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ versionUtils.ts          # Version comparison utilities
â”œâ”€â”€ parsers/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ npmParser.ts             # package.json parser
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ composerParser.ts        # composer.json parser
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pythonParser.ts          # requirements.txt parser
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ dartParser.ts            # pubspec.yaml parser
â”œâ”€â”€ updaters/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ npmUpdater.ts            # npm package updater
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ composerUpdater.ts       # composer package updater
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pythonUpdater.ts         # python package updater
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ dartUpdater.ts           # dart package updater
â”œâ”€â”€ dependencyProvider.ts        # TreeView data provider
â””â”€â”€ extension.ts                 # Extension entry point
```

## Extension Design

The extension follows a modular design pattern:

1. **Models**: Data structures used throughout the application
2. **Utils**: Shared utility functions for file operations, version comparison, and registry API interaction
3. **Parsers**: Package-manager specific parsers to extract dependency information
4. **Updaters**: Package-manager specific update mechanisms
5. **Provider**: Core TreeView implementation that coordinates the components

## Development

### Adding Support for a New Package Manager

To add support for a new package manager:

1. Create a new parser in `src/parsers/` that implements dependency extraction
2. Create a new registry fetcher in `src/utils/registryFetchers.ts`
3. Create a new updater in `src/updaters/`
4. Add detection logic to `dependencyProvider.ts`

### Running the Extension

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Press `F5` to start debugging

## Future Improvements

* Add support for more package managers (Cargo, Go Modules, etc.)
* Implement advanced version comparison for complex version constraints
* Add batch update mechanisms for dependencies
* Implement caching to reduce API calls
* Add offline mode for environments without internet access

## Usage

### Viewing Dependencies

1. Open the Explorer view in VS Code
2. Look for the "PACKAGE DEPENDENCIES" section in the sidebar
3. Click on a package file to expand and see its dependencies
4. Dependencies with available updates will show the current and latest version with color-coded indicators:
   - ðŸ”´ Major updates (potentially breaking changes)
   - ðŸŸ  Minor updates (new features, non-breaking)
   - ðŸŸ¡ Patch updates (bug fixes)
   - ðŸ”µ Prerelease versions

### Updating Packages

The extension provides several ways to update packages:

1. **Update a Single Package**:
   - Hover over a dependency with an available update
   - Click the "Update Package" button that appears
   - The package will be updated to the latest version while preserving version constraints (^, ~, etc.)

2. **Update All Packages**:
   - Click the update all icon in the Package Dependencies view header
   - Confirm that you want to update all outdated packages
   - The extension will update all outdated packages and show a progress notification

### Commands

The extension provides several commands that can be accessed via the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`):

- **Check Package Updates**: Manually trigger a check for outdated dependencies
- **Refresh Dependencies**: Refresh the dependencies tree view
- **Update Package**: Update a selected package to the latest version
- **Update All Packages**: Update all outdated packages at once
- **Exclude Folder**: Exclude a folder from dependency scanning
- **Exclude Custom Pattern**: Exclude specific files or nested directories using glob patterns
- **Manage Exclusions**: View and remove folder exclusions

### Excluding Folders and Files

To exclude folders from scanning (useful for large monorepos or test directories):

1. Right-click on a folder in the Explorer view
2. Select "Exclude Folder from Package Checks"
3. The folder will be excluded from future scans

To exclude specific files or deeper nested directories:
1. Open the Package Dependencies view
2. Click on the "Exclude Custom Pattern" button in the view header
3. Enter a glob pattern (e.g., **/specific/path/** or **/*.specific.json)
4. The pattern will be added to the exclusion list

To manage exclusions:
1. Open the Command Palette
2. Search for "Package Version: Manage Exclusions"
3. Select the exclusions you want to remove

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `pkgVersion.excludeFolders`: List of glob patterns for folders to exclude from scanning

## Supported Package Managers

| Package Manager | File | Registry |
|----------------|------|----------|
| npm/yarn | package.json | npm registry |
| Composer | composer.json | Packagist |
| Python | requirements.txt | PyPI |
| Dart/Flutter | pubspec.yaml | pub.dev |

## Features in Detail

### Status Counter

The status bar displays a summary of your dependencies' health:
- ðŸ”´ Number of packages with major updates available
- ðŸŸ  Number of packages with minor updates available
- ðŸŸ¡ Number of packages with patch updates available
- âœ… Number of up-to-date packages

Clicking on the counter will refresh your dependencies.

### Version Preservation

When updating packages, the extension preserves the original version constraints:
- `^1.0.0` â†’ `^2.0.0` (preserves caret)
- `~1.0.0` â†’ `~1.2.0` (preserves tilde)
- `>=1.0.0` â†’ `>=1.2.0` (preserves greater than or equal)

### Multi-File Support

If your workspace contains multiple package files of the same type, the extension will ask you which file to update when using the update functionality.

## Planned Features

- Support for additional package managers (Cargo, Go modules, etc.)
- Improved handling of complex version constraints
- Caching to reduce API calls
- Offline mode
- Security vulnerability checking via Snyk API
- Separation of dependencies from dev-dependencies in UI
- Package info hover cards
- See [TASKS.md](TASKS.md) for more planned features and their implementation status
