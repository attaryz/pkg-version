This is a placeholder file for a PNG image. Since this is a text file, it cannot contain the actual binary image data.

To add the real image content:
1. Create an image showing the extension's key features
2. Save it with the name "feature-overview.png" in this location

The feature overview should illustrate:
- Multi-package manager support
- Update status indicators with color coding
- Dependencies tree view
- Package update functionality
